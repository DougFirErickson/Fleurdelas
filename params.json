{"name":"Kingcake","tagline":"An IDL implementation of a LAS file reader/writer","body":"kingcake\r\n========\r\n\r\nThe laslib class is an IDL implementation of a LAS file reader/writer. \r\nThe class object can read, write and manipulate points and/or full waveforms contain in the binary LAS file format. It can handle any LAS 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 with point format 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\r\n\r\nWe are well aware that releasing \"open source\" code in IDL might not sounds as open as C/C++ code, but at Carbomap we use this library every day in our processing workflow with fast and efficient results in LiDAR data manipulations.\r\n\r\nFor the C/C++ coders/users, we will release new exciting tools in the upcoming months.\r\n\r\nWe hope you'll enjoy it as much as we do every day.\r\n\r\nPlease report any bugs or issues at info at carbomap dot com.\r\n\r\nCarbomap has a joint expertise of more than ten years in lidar full waveform data processing. This includes bathymetric, topographic, mobile and terrestrical lidar sytems.\r\n\r\nAs for the name of the release, it celebrates the New Orleans pastry of Mardi Gras :: the King cake.\r\n\r\nEnjoy.\r\n-----------------------\r\nCreated 02/03/2014 by Antoine Cottin\r\nCarbomap Ltd.\r\n7th Floor, Appleton Tower\r\n11 Crichton Street\r\nEdinburgh\r\nEH8 9LE\r\nhttp://www.carbomap.com\r\nhttp://carbomap.wordpress.com\r\nhttp://github.com/carbomap\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
