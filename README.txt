The laslib class is an IDL implementation of a LAS file reader/writer. The class object can read, write and manipulate points and/or full waveforms contained in the binary LAS file format.
It can handle any LAS 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 with point format 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

We are well aware that releasing "open source" code in IDL might not sounds as "open” as code in C/C++, but here at Carbomap we use this library every day in processing our workflow, with fast and efficient results in LiDAR data manipulation.

For the C/C++ coders/users, we will be releasing new and exciting tools in the upcoming months.

We hope you'll enjoy it as much as we do every day.

Please let us know if you want or need more features implemented. Also report any bugs or issues at info at carbomap dot com.

As it is an open project, we would like to see you involved, so please don't hesitate to clone and/or fork this project.

Carbomap has a joint expertise of more than ten years in lidar full waveform data processing. This includes bathymetric, topographic, mobile and terrestrical lidar sytems.

If you’re wondering about the name of the release; it celebrates the New Orleans pastry of Mardi Gras :: the King cake.


Enjoy.
Antoine
