Faisdodo
========

The carbslib class is an IDL implementation of a LAS file reader/writer. The class object can read, write and manipulate points and/or full waveforms contained in the binary LAS file format.
It can handle any LAS 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 with point format 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

We are aware that although releasing "open source" code in IDL might not be as "open” as code in C/C++, but here at Carbomap we use this library every day in processing our workflow, with fast and efficient results for LiDAR data manipulation.

For the C/C++ coders/users, we will be releasing new and exciting tools in the upcoming months.

We hope you'll enjoy it as much as we do every day.

Please let us know if you want or need more features implemented. Also report any bugs or issues at info at carbomap dot com.

As it is an open project, we would like to see you involved, so please don't hesitate to clone and/or fork this project.

If you’re wondering about the name of the release; it celebrates a Cajun dance party  :: the Faisdodo.

Carbomap has a joint expertise of more than ten years in LiDAR full waveform data processing. This includes bathymetric, topographic, mobile and terrestrial LiDAR systems.
